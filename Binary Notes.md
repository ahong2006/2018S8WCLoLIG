# Binary Code

**Binary code** serves as the fundamental language of computers, enabling the representation of text, processor instructions, and data through a system reliant on just two symbols: 0 and 1. 

Each individual digit within binary code is termed a "bit," with a sequence of eight bits forming a "byte." This byte holds the equivalent of 2^8 possible values, highlighting the incredible versatility of binary notation.

To break it down:

``` - 1 bit = 2 possible values
    - 2 bits = 4 possible values
    - 3 bits = 8 possible values
    - 4 bits = 16 possible values
    - 8 bits = 256 possible values 

```
