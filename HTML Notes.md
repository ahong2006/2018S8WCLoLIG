## What is Markup Languages? :speech_balloon:
**Markup languages** are a type of computer language used to define the structure, formatting, and presentation of digital documents. They consist of a set of predefined tags or codes embedded within the text of the document. These tags help to annotate or "mark up" different elements of the content to describe how they should be structured and displayed.

**Characteristics of markup languages**:
---

**Tags and Elements**: Markup languages use tags to define elements within a document. For example, in HTML, ```html <p> and </p>```define a paragraph.

**Attributes**: Tags can also have attributes, which provide additional information about the element. For example;
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description"> 
```
specifies the source and alternate text for an image.

**Nested Structure**: Elements in markup languages can be nested within other elements, creating a hierarchical structure.

Types of Markup Languages:
---

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It defines the structure of web pages using tags like <html>, <head>, <body>, <p>, and <a>.


```html
< !DOCTYPE html> <html>
<head> <meta charset= "UTF-8"›
‹title›Title goes here‹/title> </head>
<body> </body>
</html>
```


**XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**: A flexible markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML is often used for data exchange and storage.

```xml
