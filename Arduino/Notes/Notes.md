:speech_balloon:**WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?**
---
**PROGRAMMING**: is the process of designing and building computer programs, which are sets of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.


**Programming Languages**: There are numerous programming languages, each with its syntax and rules. Popular languages include Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and many more. The choice of language often depends on the nature of the task and the preferences of the programmer.


:pencil:**What is the CPP/C++ ?**
___
**C++** is a general-purpose programming language that extends the capabilities of the C language and introduces features of object-oriented programming, and it is a high perfomance programming language.

**Advantages of C++**
**High Performance**: C++ offers close-to-the-hardware control and high performance, making it suitable for system-level programming and applications with demanding performance requirements.
Scalability: C++ allows developers to mix object-oriented and procedural programming, enabling the creation of flexible and scalable codebases.
**Low-Level Control**: C++ permits direct control over memory and hardware, allowing developers to optimize code to meet specific requirements.
**Rich Community Support**: C++ has a large and active development community, providing abundant resources, libraries, and tools that developers can benefit from.
**Cross-Platform Capability**: C++ programs can be compiled and run on multiple platforms, providing cross-platform compatibility.
